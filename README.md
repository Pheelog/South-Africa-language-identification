# South-Africa-language-identification
South Africa is a multicultural society that is characterised by its rich linguistic diversity. Language is an indispensable tool that can be used to deepen democracy and also contribute to the social, cultural, intellectual, economic and political life of the South African society. With such a multilingual population, it is only obvious that our systems and devices also communicate in multi-languages. In this project I will train a machine that can take text which is in any of South Africa's 11 Official languages and identify which language the text is in.
